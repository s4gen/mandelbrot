ACCESIBLE AT https://mandelbrot-visual.netlify.app/

My best work yet, I think.

It's a visualizer of the Mandelbrot set. I've always been obsessed with fractals and this is my favorite. Iterations help with accuracy, especially at higher zoom levels. (The zoom counter is a bit broken)
I used C++ to optimize the math part, since the computation of the Mandelbrot set requires complex numbers, it's quite intensive on the CPU and such. I fiddled around with importing C++ on Javascript, took ages, but it worked. I'm really proud of this though.
